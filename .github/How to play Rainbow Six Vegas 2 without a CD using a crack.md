# How to play Rainbow Six Vegas 2 without a CD using a crack
 
If you have bought Rainbow Six Vegas 2, a tactical shooter game by Ubisoft, but you don't want to insert the CD every time you want to play, you might be interested in using a crack. A crack is a modified version of the game executable file that bypasses the CD check and allows you to play without the original disc. However, using a crack might also expose you to some risks, such as viruses, malware, or online bans. Therefore, you should always backup your original files and scan any downloaded files for viruses before using them.

In this article, we will show you how to use a crack for Rainbow Six Vegas 2 version 1.03, which is the latest official patch for the game. This crack was released by a group called Battery and can be found on GameCopyWorld[^1^], a website that provides game fixes and trainers for various PC games. You can also find other versions of cracks and patches for Rainbow Six Vegas 2 on the same website.
 
Before you use the crack, you need to install the official patch Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 v1.03, which fixes some bugs and improves the game performance. You can download the patch from Ubisoft's website or from other sources online. After you have installed the patch, follow these steps to use the crack:
 
1. Go to GameCopyWorld[^1^] and search for "Rainbow Six Vegas 2".
2. Click on the link that says "Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 - PC Game Trainer Cheat PlayFix No-CD No-DVD | GameCopyWorld".
3. Scroll down to the section that says "Game Fixes" and look for the file that says "Rainbow Six: Vegas 2 v1.03 [MULTI5] No-DVD/Fixed EXE".
4. Click on the file name to download it. You might need to enter a captcha code or wait for a few seconds before the download starts.
5. Extract the file from the zip archive using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
6. Copy the file R6VEGAS2\_GAME.EXE from the extracted folder and paste it into your game installation folder, usually located at C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Vegas 2\Binaries\. You might need to overwrite the existing file, so make sure you have a backup of it.
7. Run the game as usual. You should see a splash screen with Battery's logo and then the game menu. You don't need to insert the CD anymore.

Congratulations! You have successfully used a crack for Rainbow Six Vegas 2 version 1.03. You can now enjoy the game without having to worry about losing or damaging your CD. However, be aware that using a crack might prevent you from playing online or accessing some features of the game. Also, some antivirus programs might detect the crack as a threat and block it or delete it. If that happens, you might need to disable your antivirus temporarily or add an exception for the crack file.
